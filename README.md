# Design a Bauhaus homepage
(c)2011 Albert Villaroman <avdeveloper@gmail.com>

The project was to design a home page for the school's Integrated Digital Media department. As it turns out, I used the wrong homepage to use as reference.

## Topics/Technologies covered
* Bauhaus history and design principles
* CSS3 rotation

## Warning: Bad practices
* markup is not as semantic as I would have preferred
* colors are way off to be considered Bauhaus (I apologize)
